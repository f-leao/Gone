<h1>Welcome to Gone</h1>
Story: AI-generated games have been on the rise for quite a while now. You are a rogue character who has accidentally been brought to life, and now you want revenge! Be careful! The other characters won't make it easy!

Winning conditions: Reach the end of the level, and colect the lively object!

Powerups:

Featherweight makes you very light and nimble for the next jump.
Dash makes you fly through the air at a god-like speed!
Energy gives you one charge of the Death Ray. Be careful with that!
There are many checkpoints throughout the level so you don't have to play through the whole level each time you die.

Keybinds:

Use W, A, S, D to move.
Use the mouse to aim.
C lets you look at your character.
Hold Shift while moving to sprint.
The left mouse button is used to fire that powerful Death Ray.
B takes you to your last saved checkpoint.
N takes you to the next checkpoint.
